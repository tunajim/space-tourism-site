## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a great practice in planning for responsive design.  I found myself going back and restructuring my HTML to allow me to achieve specific designs at each breakpoint.  Going forward, I will not even begin coding until I have adequately planned the structure of my HTML so that I can easily adjust the page layout without having to perform confusing workarounds. 

### Continued development

I want to continue building these sites so that I can have a solid grasp of how a webpage should be structured while also taking into account accessibility.  I am feeling confident with my JavaScript skills so continuing to focus on mastering the basics of HTML and CSS will be the best use of my time.
